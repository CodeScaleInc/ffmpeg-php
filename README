FFmpegPHP 2.5b1

FFmpegPHP is a pure OO PHP port of ffmpeg-php writter in C. It adds an easy to use,
object-oriented API for accessing and retrieving information from video and audio files.
It has methods for returning frames from movie files as images that can be manipulated
using PHP's image functions. This works well for automatically creating thumbnail images from movies.
FFmpegPHP is also useful for reporting the duration and bitrate of audio files (mp3, wma...).
FFmpegPHP can access many of the video formats supported by ffmpeg (mov, avi, mpg, wmv...) 

Notes for 2.5b1:
Code completely refactored. OutputProvider interface is now available.
OutputProvider Interface allows to implement custom output providers.
FFmpegMovie class no longer responsible for getting output from ffmpeg/ffprobe
binaries.
Phpunit tests completely fixed for the environemnt:
    FFmpeg version SVN-r25769
    FFprobe version SVN-r25769
    PHP 5.3.3


Notes for 2.0b1:
phpunit tests tends to fail due to ffmpeg output incompatibility. FFprobe executable
was introduced, but its output doesn't contain information about video or audio bitrates.
I do believe that ffprobe -show_tags is buggy for track tag, and always returns 0. This
behaviour causes further fails in unit tests.
Tested against ffmpeg SVN-r0.5.1-4:0.5.1-1ubuntu1
               ffprobe SVN-r20090707
               php 5.3.2
